# TM1 Migration Utility Log Renderer

Work-In-Progress

GOAL: Create a migration report, given the consumer some quick insights into how his migration did, based on the log generated by TM1's migration utility

Usage, in combination with migration utility:

```bash
migrate_tm1.exe -i <<path-to-tm1-v11-data-directory>> -o <<path-to-v12-backupset-file-to-be-created>> -l /dev/stdout | jq -s '.' | ./render_migration_log.sh <<path-to-file-to-write-report-to>> 
```

Note that the `.html` extension is added by the script and therefore does not need to be added to the name of the report file to be created.
